# SwissArmyKnife

A collection of tools that I use for various things.

Most of these will be contained to a single folder.  The README in that folder will explain what the tool is.

## Current Tools

- :white_check_mark: Working.
- :construction: In Progress.
- :x: Not Working.

---

- :white_check_mark: video :: phone_video_compressor
- :white_check_mark: credential_mgmt :: sops

## Making a New Toy

Use:

```shell
just generate tool_name
```

Where `tool_name` is the name of the tool.  It will make a folder in root.  Move it to where it should be.
