## Description

Given a User Input (text), generates a words-per-sentence graph as well as statistics on sentence length.  Compares to some other (famous) writers.

## Quickstart

If you have `just`:

    ```shell
    # To start up the docker container...
    just up

    # When you're done...
    just down
    ```

Otherwise you can use docker compose commands:

    ```shell
    # To start up the docker container...
    docker compose up --remove-orphans -w

    # When you're done...
    docker compose down --remove-orphans --volumes
    ```

To open the application go to <localhost:8501>.
